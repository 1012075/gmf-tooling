<h2>Annotated Models</h2>

<p>This package contains classes that derive graphical definition, tooling definition
and mapping GMF models from specially annotated domain (ecore) model. Using these
model setup classes user may easily define data for GMF unit tests. Generator model
could be obtained by transforming mapping model. Essentially this is a simple alternative
to GMF definition models that is specially designed to provide unit tests data.

<p>Code that infers other models from domain model searches for annotations with 'gmf'
source and uses details entries of annotations to produce related model elements.
Here is a list of annotation details entry names supported in domain model:
<ul>
	<li><b>canvas</b> - annotated EClass will be used as diagram canvas element</li>
	<li><b>node</b> - node mapping with creation tool and diagram node with figure will be
		created for the annotated EClass</li>
	<li><b>compartment</b> - compartment mapping with diagram element is created;
		value of details entry specifies compartment name; compartment
		is defined within node mapping of the annotated EClass</li>
	<li><b>in</b> - value of details entry specifies name of the compartment defined
		in parent EClass</li>	
	<li><b>link</b> - link mapping with creation tool and diagram connection with figure
		will be created for the annotated EClass or EReference</li>
	<li><b>containment</b> - name of the containment feature specified as EClass name
		plus dot plus feature name such as 'Library.writers'</li>
	<li><b>source</b> - name of the source feature for the link mapping</li>
	<li><b>target</b> - name of the target feature for the link mapping</li>
	<li><b>label</b> - label mapping will be defined for the annotated EAttribute</li>
</ul>
